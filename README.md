# python_blackjack
A text-based blackjack game written in Python. This module uses object-oriented programming to create classes that 
represent the game state and card deck, and objects which represent the dealer and player's hands.

While I know that blackjack traditionally lets you split doubles and has a few other rules, I went the simpler route and omitted
those for this game :)
